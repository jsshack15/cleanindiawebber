	<h1>ABOUT CLEAN INDIA COMPAIGN</h1><hr>
	<h5>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (English: Clean India Mission and abbreviated as SBA or SBM for "Swachh Bharat Mission") is a national campaign by theGovernment of India, covering 4,041 statutory cities and towns, to clean the streets, roads and infrastructure of the country.
The campaign was officially launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself cleaned the road. It was performed in remembrance of Mahatma Gandhi's words. It is India's biggest ever cleanliness drive and 3 million government employees and school and college students of India participated in this event.The mission was started by Prime Minister Modi, who nominated nine famous personalities for the campaign, and they took up the challenge and nominated nine more people and so on. It has been carried forward since then with people from all walks of life joining it.
With effect from 1 April 1999, the Government of India restructured the Comprehensive Rural Sanitation Programme and launched the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) which was later (on 1 April 2012) renamed Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA).This formed the basis of Swachh Bharat Mission.
</h5>
<h5>
This campaign aims to accomplish the vision of a 'Clean India' by 2 October 2019, the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. Specific objectives are:<br>
•	Elimination of open defecation.<br>
•	Conversion of unsanitary toilets to pour flush toilets (a type of pit latrine, usually connected to two pits).<br>
•	Eradication of manual scavenging.<br>
•	100% collection and processing/disposal/reuse/recycling of municipal solid waste.<br>
•	A behavioural change in people regarding healthy sanitation practices.<br>
•	Generation of awareness among citizens about sanitation and its linkages withpublic health.<br>
•	Supporting urban local bodies in designing, executing and operating waste disposal systems.<br>
•	Facilitating private-sector participation in capital expenditure and operation and maintenance costs for sanitary facilities.<br>

<h1>Why We Need To Be Focus On This Compaign:</h1><hr>
<img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="E:\hackathon-clean india\pic_assests\reuse.png"/>
<h1><b>Recycle | Reuse | Reduce</b></h1>
<h6>The items people throw out all take energy to make; many of them are not biodegradable and may take centuries to break down. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Americans produced 4.3 lbs. of trash per person per day in 2009 (see References 2, page 1). Reducing, reusing and recycling -- the three Rs -- are the ways consumers can minimize the volume of waste they generate.<br><h1><b>-Reducing</b></h1><br>
Reducing is the first and most effective of the three Rs . It means reducing your consumption or buying less. Designing items like plastic bottles in ways that use less material is another way to reduce consumption. Using steel cutlery instead of plastic utensils, buying used goods, mending clothes instead of buying new ones and consuming less electricity are all examples of ways you can reduce in your own life.<br><b><h1>-Reusing</b></h1><br>
Rather than throwing out items like clothing or food jars, consumers can find new uses for them -- and thereby reduce their consumption of new resources. Composting, using jars to store beverages or leftover food, and trading or selling used DVDs rather than throwing them out are all examples of ways people can reuse. Reusing is the second most effective of the three Rs; like reducing, it avoids creating waste rather than trying to recycle it once it's already there.<br>
<b><h1>-Recycling</b></h1><br>
Recycling is the third of the three Rs. Recycling extracts valuable materials from items that might otherwise be considered trash and turns them into new products. Communities have a variety of recycling programs, such as curbside pickup of recyclables, drop-off centers, buy-back centers that pay you for valuable items and deposit-refund programs. Deposit-refund programs, which include a deposit as part of the product price, refund consumers when they recycle such items as soda cans and plastic bottles. As a consumer, you can also help recycling by purchasing products made from recycled material, such as toilet paper made from recycled pulp.<br><h1>-Why Is It Important?</h1>
<br>Manufacturers extracting natural resources, such as bauxite or aluminum ore, and refining them to make products use energy in the process. Often, burning fossil fuels generates this energy. When people throw those items away, they send them to landfills where they may take centuries or longer to break down completely. Reducing, reusing and recycling help reduce humanity's environmental footprint, carbon dioxide emissions and energy use and limits the amount of landfill space people create. These savings can be substantial; recycling aluminum uses only 5 percent of the energy required to refine aluminum. That's why the three Rs are the basic tenets of modern environmentalism.

<h1><b>Water Conservation</b></h1>
<h6>Water conservation encompasses the policies, strategies and activities made to manage fresh water as a sustainable resource, to protect the water environment, and to meet current and future human demand. Population, household size, and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as climate change will increase pressures on natural water resources especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation.<br>
<h1>The goals of water conservation efforts include:</h1><br>

Ensuring availability of water for future generations. This requires that the withdrawal of fresh water from an ecosystem does not exceed its natural replacement rate.<br>
Energy conservation. Water pumping, delivery and waste water treatment facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world over 15% of total electricity consumption is devoted to water management.<br>
Habitat conservation. Minimizing human water use helps to preserve fresh fire habitats for local wildlife and migrating waterfowl, as well as reduces the need to build new dams and other water diversion infrastructures.<br>

-In implementing water conservation principles, there are a number of key activities that may be beneficial.<br>

->Any beneficial reduction in water loss, use and waste of resources.<br>
->Avoiding any damage to water quality.<br>
->Improving water management practices that reduce or enhance the beneficial use of water.<br><hr>

<h1><b>Why We Need To Focus On Clean India Compaign:</b></h1>
Under "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan", the government has promised "total sanitation" by 2019, which means every household in India will have a toilet by the targeted deadline. So let us take a look at why is this Clean India mission the need of the hour today:<br> 
1. A UN report in May had said that currently, nearly 60 percent of India's population practice open defecation which puts them at risk of diseases like cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid etc. <br>
2. Not only this, India also face economic loss because of poor hygiene and sanitation in the country as a World Bank report in 2006 said that India losses 6.4 percent of GDP annually because of the aforementioned reason.<br>
3. Reports say that India is a gold medalist in open defecation and nearly 60 per cent of Indian population clear their bowels in the open. This 60 percent is roughly 58% of the people who practise open defecation all over the world.<br> 
4. India loses at least 1000 children a day to diarrhoeal deaths and the reason for these deaths is open defecation and lack of proper sanitation facilities.<br> 
5. As per reports, water of river Ganga is unsafe for bathing because it contains faecal coliform bacteria (120 times higher than the permitted levels) in large amounts and again the reason is open defecation in our country.<br> 
6. Poor hygiene and sanitation facilities costs India 600,000 lives annually becuase of diarrhea and not only this, lack of toilets also expose one third of country's women to the risk of rape or sexual assault.<br> 
7. India accounts for about 60 percent of the world's residents without toilets, according to a report released in May by the World Health Organization and Unicef.<br> 
8. Swachh Bharat's connection with economic activity of the country : Advocating the idea of Clean india, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said, "The pursuit of cleanliness can be an economic activity, contributing to GDP growth, reduction in healthcare costs, and a source of employment.<br> 
9. If India and its tourist destinations are clean, it will bring more people and will also bring about a paradigm shift in the country's global perception. If proper hygiene and sanitation will not become a practise in our country then no one will be able to save the country from the health hazards and losses that will loom over the Indian populace in near future. So, let's make Swachh Bharat a mass movement and save our country from all the dangers.
